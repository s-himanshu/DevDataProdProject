Developing Data Products - Project
=========================
This is a submission for Coursera: Developing Data Products- Course Project


Welcome to the "Best Car for your Trip" app, that was developed for the course 'Developing Data Products', from Coursera. This app helps you to choose a car for a trip, using the mtcars dataset from [R]. 

Primarily, you need to specify the expected distance to be travelled, the price of gasoline in your region, and your fuel budget. This information will be used to calculate the Gasoline Expenditure for each car in the dataset. The output table shows only the cars that have Miles per Gallon (mpg) that can go below this value.

Advanced users can choose some more characteristics of the cars that you desire: Cylinders, Displacement, Horse Power and Transmission. The table will show only the cars with the filters selected. You can sort the table according to the variable you want by clicking the arrows at the top of the table.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/s-himanshu/dataproducts).
